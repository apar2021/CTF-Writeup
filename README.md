# CTF Writeups

This repository contains writeups for various **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges I've completed. Each folder contains a detailed writeup of a specific challenge, including the steps, techniques, and tools used to solve it.

CTF competitions are cybersecurity challenges that involve solving puzzles and problems related to topics such as cryptography, reverse engineering, web security, forensics, and more. These writeups are intended to document my solutions, share knowledge, and help others learn from my approach.

## Tools and Techniques

Some of the tools and techniques used in my writeups:

- **Tools**:
  - Ghidra, IDA Pro (for reverse engineering)
  - Burp Suite, Postman (for web security)
  - Wireshark (for network analysis)
  - John the Ripper, Hashcat (for password cracking)
  - Python, Bash (for scripting)

- **Techniques**:
  - Binary analysis and reverse engineering
  - Cryptographic attacks (Brute force, cipher cracking, etc.)
  - SQL injection and web shell exploitation
  - Buffer overflows and memory corruption
  - Network forensics and traffic analysis
